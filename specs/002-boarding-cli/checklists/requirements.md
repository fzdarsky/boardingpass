# Specification Quality Checklist: Boarding CLI Tool

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**:

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

**Spec Quality Summary**:
- ✅ All mandatory sections completed (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)
- ✅ 6 prioritized user stories with independent test criteria
- ✅ 20 functional requirements, all testable and unambiguous
- ✅ 7 measurable success criteria, all technology-agnostic
- ✅ 8 edge cases identified for consideration during planning
- ✅ Assumptions documented for implementation context
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are clear with reasonable defaults
- ✅ No implementation details (languages, frameworks, specific tools)
- ✅ Written from user/business perspective

The specification successfully describes WHAT the CLI tool should do and WHY it's valuable, without prescribing HOW to implement it. All requirements are verifiable and acceptance scenarios provide clear test criteria.
